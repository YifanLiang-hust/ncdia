# üìö OpenHAIV Documentation

The framework adopts a modular design overall, which is reflected in two key aspects:

- **Functionally**, it independently incorporates dedicated modules for supervised training, out-of-distribution detection, novel class discovery, and incremental learning. 
- **Procedurally**, the framework divides its operational workflow into distinct stages, including data processing, model construction, training \& evaluation, and visualization.

From an implementation perspective, the framework is built upon foundational deep learning, data processing, and visualization libraries such as PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, leveraging their extensive built-in functionalities.

This comprehensive framework provides researchers with a robust foundation for tackling open world learning challenges, from initial model training through continuous adaptation to novel scenarios.
